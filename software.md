## Free Software I wrote

* [Faber](http://stefan.seefeld.name/faber/)

  Faber is a modern, platform-agnostic build tool, which I have been
  developing, originally as a new Python frontend to 
  [Boost.Build](http://www.boost.org/build/), but which has 
  meanwhile developed a life of its own...
	
* [OpenVSIP](http://openvsip.org)

  OpenVSIP is a high-quality implementation of the VSIPL++ standard,
  originally developed by CodeSourcery as Sourcery VSIPL++.

* [Synopsis](http://stefan.seefeld.name/synopsis/)

  Synopsis is a multi-language source code introspection tool that
  provides a variety of representations for the parsed code, to
  enable further processing such as documentation extraction,
  reverse engineering, and source-to-source translation.

  I started the project as a support tool for Fresco, but it quickly
  turned out that its capabilities would provide the means to do far
  more, so it spun off and began to develop a life of its own.

* [QMTest](http://stefan.seefeld.name/qmtest/)

  QMTest is an automated software test execution tool. It started
  its life as an entry in the testing category of the
  [Software Carpentry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Carpentry)
  competition (of which it emerged as the winner). These days the
  tool is used in areas as different as GCC unit testing as well as
  benchmark execution.

  I have been contributing to its development, but these days am
  mostly only maintaining it.

	
* [Roundup](http://www.roundup-tracker.org)

  Roundup is an issue tracking system. It, too, emerged as the
  winner to the [Software Carpentry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Carpentry)
  design competition.

  I have been contributing to the project over the years to various
  degrees.
	
* [boost.org](http://www.boost.org)

  Boost is a collection of C++ libraries, to a high degree targeted
  at eventually becoming part of the C++ language / library
  specification.

  I am maintaining the Boost.Python library, a tool to help generate
  C++ - Python language bindings. I also keep a Boost.XML library
  alive in the sandbox, despite not finding enough time, energy, and
  courage, to submit it for formal review. Finally, I have
  contributed to boost.wave, a C/C++ preprocessor library, as I
  would like to use it as backend to the Synopsis Cpp processor.
	
* [Fresco](http://www.fresco.org)

  Fresco is a structured graphics - based Windowing System. It
  evolved out of a research project at Stanford University.

  Fresco's development has been stalled for a couple of years.
	
* [SCons](www.scons.org)

  SCons is a software construction tool. As Roundup and QMTest above,
  it, too, was the winner of the Software Carpentry competition in
  its respective category.

  I have contributed to this project in the past, and in particular,
  mentored a student as part of the Google Summer of Code 2007
  project, to add support for portable packaging.

Beside active involvement into the above projects, I have made
various contributions (ranging from patches to cheerleading) to the
following projects:

	
  * [docbook](http://docbook.org/)
  * xmlroff
  * [sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/)
  * [buildbot](http://buildbot.net/)
