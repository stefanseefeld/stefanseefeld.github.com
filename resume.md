# Résumé

* About 30 years experience developing advanced system level and scientific software in the industry, an academic setting, and in the free software community
* Through scientific background and experience with a wide range of languages and techniques. Very proficient with domain-specific modeling and design.
* Very experienced with portable, platform independent development. This applies as much to the source code as to the infrastructure (building, testing, packaging).
* Experience with medical software development, as well as standardization work.
* Many years of experience in mentoring developers and coordinating projects

## Skills
### Software Engineering:

* Programming languages:
  C++, Python, Java, bash, ...
* Scientific programming:
  Molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, Dynamical Systems, Signal- and Image Processing
* System programming:
  * Embedded Systems (Yocto), GNU/Linux, Windows
  * Distributed Systems (IPC, RPC, HTTP, sockets)
  * Parallelism (SIMD, threads, OpenMP, MPI, CUDA)
  * Libraries and frameworks: Qt, VTK, boost, SciPy, Jupyter
* Software engineering and project administration:
  * OOP, OOA/D, UML, Multi-Paradigm design, Generic Programming
  * Project coordination and administration using github, bitbucket, JIRA, ...
  * Daily use of development tools like git, gcc, cmake, python, jupyter, postgresql, docbook, docker
* Standardization work
  * Chair [HPEC Working Group](http://portals.omg.org/hpec) at OMG
  * Maintain [VSIPL](http://www.omg.org/spec/VSIPL/) / [VSIPL++](http://www.omg.org/spec/VSIPL++/) standards

### Languages
  * German, English, French:
    spoken fluently and daily

## Experience

[THINK Surgical](http://thinksurgical.com) (2018 – present)

**Principal Software Engineer**

* Design and develop build infrastructure and software supply-chain management 
* Design and develop 3D tracker simulator and test methodology for navigation software system
* Design interfaces and data models for patient records and implant modules, to support entire workflow from preoperative planning to post-market surveillance

[Continuum Analytics](http://www.anaconda.com/) (2015 - 2017)

**Senior Software Engineer**

* Design and develop numerical and data-processing libraries and support tools using a combination of Python, C,and C++.
* Develop build and packaging infrastructure in support of the Anaconda distribution.

[Mentor Graphics](http://www.mentor.com/) (2010 - 2015)

**Software Architect**

  * Design and develop numerical libraries in the High Performance Embedded Computing (HPEC) space.
  * Port HPC code to various platforms including Cell/B.E. and NVidia CUDA.
  * Develop integrated development workflows from prototyping (Matlab, SciPy) to target-specific optimization (C++, compiler intrinsics, etc.)
  * Manage releases for various products.
  * Coordinate architecture-level efforts related to various projects.
  * Work on VSIPL++ standardization within OMG.
  * Co-chair HPEC Working Group within OMG.

[CodeSourcery](http://www.codesourcery.com) (2005 - 2010)

**Sourcerer**

  * Design and develop numerical libraries in the High Performance Embedded Computing (HPEC) space.
  * Port HPC code to various platforms including Cell/B.E. and NVidia CUDA.
  * Manage Sourcery VSIPL++ releases.
  * Work on VSIPL++ standardization.

[ORTHOsoft](http://www.orthosoft.ca) (2001 - 2004)

**Software Developer**

  * Design and develop a new document-centric architecture based on an Electronic Patient Record.
This includes various services such as persistence, recording / playback, and logging, and is based on XML (using DOM and SAX APIs).
  * Design and develop a portable component model that was used to refactor (i.e. modularize)
the whole product suite.
  * Develop and maintain the Motion Capture component with its principal implementation using
the NDI Polaris Tracking System. Bind this component to a scene graph (based on openGL and OpenSceneGraph) for real-time rendering of tracked surgical instruments.
  * Develop a scripting frontend (python) for a number of components using boost.python
  * Enhance the development environment by writing a new build system (using MSVC++, gcc, MipsPro, make, autoconf), a new unit testing framework (using qmtest), code documentation tool (using synopsis), and internal web site (using apache, a wiki, in-house cgi scripts, etc.).
  * Enhanced the software's portability to now support MS Windows, GNU/Linux, and IRIX.

[The Berlin / Fresco Project](http://www.fresco.org) (1998 - 2003)

**Architect and Principal Developer**

Fresco is a highly modular, multi-threaded, distributed 3D enabled windowing system, based on a persistent scene graph with server-interpolated high color/spatial resolution and server-side UI components.

  * I designed and implemented most of the system using CORBA IDL, C++, Python. The implementation contains various system level and graphics libraries to make it highly portable, scalable and extensible. Lower level APIs that are being used include openGL, POSIX, CORBA 2.3, etc.
  * I implemented the build system for Berlin using tools such as make, autotools, perl
  * I presented the project at various international conferences, such as the Ottawa Linux Symposium (Canada) or the LinuxTag (Germany)

[SIGGRAPH Montreal](http://montreal.siggraph.org) (2001 - 2002)

**Member of the founding comitee**

[The Synopsis Project](http://synopsis.fresco.org) (2000 - present)

**Coordinator and Lead Developer**

Synopsis is a modular source code inspection tool, mainly designed to generate reference manuals from inlined documentation. It supports a variety of languages through the use of pluggable parsers, as well as a wide range of output generators, such as HTML, XML, or UML graphs.

  * I designed the overall layout of the framework, the data flow, as well as the class hierarchy used.
  * I implemented the core of the application (in python), as well as some of the parsers and formatters (C++, python).
