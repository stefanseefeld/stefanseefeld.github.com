It's this time of year again. I typically don't go to many concerts, but instead take my refill a little earlier in the year, at the [Festival Musique Actuelle](http://www.fimav.qc.ca) in Victoriaville. Not so this year. The FIMAV organizers had decided (or where forced) to skip a year, so I went looking for interesting concerts here in [Montr√©al](http://www.montrealjazzfest.com) to take in. Usually this is a little hard, as the festival has somewhat degraded over the years, to the point that some even call it the "Carneval du Jazz".

I was lucky, though, and got to see two concerts: One with Gary Burton, Pat Metheny, Steve Swallow, and Antonio Sanchez. The other with Bill Frisell, Ron Miles, Tony Scherr, and Rudy Royston.
Both concerts were fabulous. As each time, I'm totally blown away by Bill Frisell's ensembles, and their musicality.
