Last night we went to a concert [friends](http://www.constantinople.ca) of us gave, together with an invited ensemble from Corsica: [Barbara Furtuna](http://www.barbara-furtuna.fr).
The concert was amazing. In particular, I noticed the homogeneity of the singers. Their vocal technique gives them an unusually wide range of harmonics, making it easier to adjust the pitch.
One of the singers noted in the concert that they don't actually read music, making a collaboration such as this one particularly challenging.
(How do they communicate to work on pieces performed together with other groups such as Constantinople ?)
