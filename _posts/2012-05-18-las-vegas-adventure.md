After a rather inspiring (yet exhausting) week at [GTC](http://www.gputechconf.com/), I'm on my way home from San Francisco to Montreal. I had chosen to fly via SFO instead of SJC, because the connection appeared to be slightly better. On my flight from YUL to SFO, the crew encountered a "minor" technical issue, and chose to land in Denver instead of San Francisco. While we were supposed to take off again within an hour, we sat on the tarmac for >3 hours, when it was announced that the problem was bigger than originally thought, such that the plane could only take off the next day.

I managed to get a different flight to SJC, to arrive 12 hours late at my destination.

Now I'm on my way back, taking a two-leg flight from SFO via LAS to YUL. Arriving in LAS after 22:00, it's apparently too late to have anyone in the terminal who can give useful information. When I finally figured out where to go to get the connection flight, and make it yet again through security, the plane is already taxiing towards the runway. So I'm stuck in this unfriendly, noisy, and inhumane place (which ironically claims to be the Mecca of the Western world) for the night, .and be home in Montreal 12 hours late.

This makes me miss a [concert](http://fimav.qc.ca/en/artistes/john-zorn-the-concealed-en/) I have been looking forward to see for months. How annoying...
