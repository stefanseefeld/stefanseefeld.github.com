A too short and too rainy summer has almost passed by in a blink of an eye. I mentored two [GSoC](http://code.google.com/soc/) projects this year. One of them, adding [Python 3](http://python.org) support to [boost.python](http://www.boost.org/), was very successful, and I just merged the [changes](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/changeset/56305) into trunk. As I don't expect any surprises there, I'm sure the code will be ready for inclusion into the next release. Yay !

The other project wasn't quite as successful. Not only did it require a lot more hand-holding from my part, but it didn't result in nearly as much improvements as we had hoped for.

Neither result came as a surprise. In fact, I probably could have predicted it when reviewing the applications. But as I'm an optimist, I always hope for a better outcome, even if there are warning signs. As I will participate in this year's GSoC Mentor Summit, I'm sure I will hear from other people what they have to suggest as to how to evaluate proposals to avoid surprises.
