I'v just come back from this year's [Bossa conference](http://bossaconference.indt.org), which took place near Porto de Galinhas, Pernambuco, Brazil.
I was invited to talk about Hybrid Programming using [Boost.Python](boostorg.github.io/python/).
The conference was interesting, allowing me to look at Free Software as used in embedded mobile devices (read: cell phones).
It was also a great opportunity to socialize, and just have a great time.
