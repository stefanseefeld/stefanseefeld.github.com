Spring is here !

Google just published the list of this year's GSoC [mentoring organizations](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/program/accepted_orgs/google/gsoc2010). [DocBook](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/org/show/google/gsoc2010/docbook) will participate for a first time, as will (as usual) [Boost](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/org/show/google/gsoc2010/boost). If you are interested in any of this, don't hesitate to get in touch !

I have also started looking into switching to [CLang](http://clang.llvm.org/) as Cpp/C/Cxx parsers for [Synopsis](http://synopsis.fresco.org). While this looks very promising, there is still quite a lot of work that needs to be done before this will be usable. Any help is highly appreciated.
