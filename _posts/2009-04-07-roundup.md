I have recently completed a 1-month sabbatical that allowed me to work on [Roundup](http://www.roundup-tracker.org). A big part of that consisted in pushing upstream lots of small (and occasionally not so small) fixes and enhancements that we developed at [CodeSourcery](http://codesourcery.com). (For example, we dramatically improved performance for serving (large) files.)
I also worked on the XMLRPC frontend (hoping that this will allow customized client applications to be written).
Overall, I'm very happy with this work. As I knew I was going to work on this, I started by rewriting the Roundup website (discovering [sphinx](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/) in the process), and migrating Roundup's own bug tracker away from sf.net, near the python.org tracker. (We are finally [self-hosting](http://issues.roundup-tracker.org) !)
The desired effect was to help revive the Roundup community (both, user and developer). It seems this worked well: now we even have a candidate project for this year's [Google Summer of Code](http://socghop.appspot.com/) !
